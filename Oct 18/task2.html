             over two days in 1759 during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Years%27_War">Seven Years' War.</a>
             the French fleet successfully passed through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strait_of_Gibraltar">Strait of Gibraltar</a> , but was sighted by a British ship 
             shortly after it entered the Atlantic. The British fleet was in nearby <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> ,undergoing a major refit.
             It left port amidst great confusion, most ships not having their refurbishments completed, with many delayed 
             and sailing in a second squadron. Aware that he was pursued, La Clue altered his plan and changed course; half
             his ships failed to follow him in the dark, but the British did.

             The British caught up with the French on the 18th and fierce fighting ensued, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_C%C3%A1diz">Gult of cadiz</a>during which several ships were
              badly damaged and one French ship was captured. The British, who greatly outnumbered the remaining six French
               ships, pursued them through the moonlit night of 18/19 August, during which a further two French ships made 
               their escape. On the 19th the remnants of the French fleet attempted to shelter in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral_country"> neutral</a> Portuguese waters
                near <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos,_Portugal">Lagos</a> , but Boscawen violated that neutrality, capturing a further two French ships and destroying the 
                other two.(<b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Lagos">Full Article...</a></b>) </p>
